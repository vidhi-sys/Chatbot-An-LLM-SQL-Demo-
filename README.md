# üç¨ Sweet Shop Chatbot: An LLM & SQL Demo üç≠üç´üç≠
https://github.com/vidhi-sys/Chatbot_LLM_SQL_Demo/raw/main/banner.png

A delightful chatbot that lets you explore a virtual sweet shop's inventory using natural language! This project demonstrates how to combine the power of local Large Language Models (LLMs) with SQL databases to create interactive, data-driven applications.

## üåü Features

- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask about inventory in plain English
- **Local LLM Processing**: Privacy-focused, no data leaves your computer
- **SQL Database Integration**: Real-time inventory management
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the database or LLM model
- **Educational**: Perfect for learning about RAG and LLM-SQL integration

## üß† How the Magic Works

1. **Your Question**: You ask something like "What's the most expensive chocolate?"
2. **LLM Brainpower**: A local language model understands your query and converts it to SQL
3. **Database Query**: The generated SQL queries your sweet shop database
4. **Sweet Response**: You get a natural language answer with the requested information

```
[Your Question] --> [LLM converts to SQL] --> [Database Query] --> [Formatted Response]
```

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

- A sweet tooth üç™ (optional but recommended)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- At least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended for smoother LLM operation)

### Step 1: Install Python Libraries

Open your terminal and install the required packages:

```bash
pip install ollama langchain_community langchain_core sqlite3
```

### Step 2: Set Up Ollama and Your LLM

1. **Install Ollama**:
   - Visit [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai) and download for your OS
   - Or use this quick command for Linux/Mac:
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
     ```

2. **Download a Language Model**:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3  # Or try mistral, codellama, or phi3
   ```

3. **Start the Ollama Server**:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Sweet Shop Chatbot!

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

The script will automatically:
- Create a delicious database of sweets üç´
- Populate it with tempting treats
- Ready itself for your questions!

## üç´ Sample Questions to Try

Once everything is running, ask questions like:

- "How many types of chocolate do you have?"
- "What's the most expensive sweet?"
- "Which items have less than 20 in stock?"
- "List all gummy sweets by price"
- "What's the total value of my inventory?"

## üé® Customization Ideas

Make this project your own:

1. **Add More Sweets**: Edit the `initialize_database()` function in `chatbot.py`
2. **Change the LLM**: Try different models like `mistral`, `phi3`, or `codellama`
3. **Extend Functionality**: Add user accounts, shopping cart, or order processing
4. **Visualize Data**: Connect to a dashboard tool like Grafana or Tableau

## üìä Database Schema

The sweet shop database contains a single table:

| Column           | Type    | Description                          |
|------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| id               | INTEGER | Primary key, auto-incrementing       |
| sweet_name       | TEXT    | Name of the sweet treat              |
| sweet_type       | TEXT    | Category (chocolate, gummy, etc.)    |
| price            | REAL    | Price in dollars                     |
| quantity_in_stock| INTEGER | How many are available               |
| description      | TEXT    | Mouth-watering description           |

## ü§î Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Ollama won't start | Check if your system meets the requirements |
| Model not found | Run `ollama pull <model_name>` again |
| Out of memory | Try a smaller model like `phi3` |
| SQL errors | Check the database connection in the script |
